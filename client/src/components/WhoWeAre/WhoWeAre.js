      <h1>Shira Appelbaum</h1>
      <p>Shira joined the Sky Logger team in 2014 and became our chief pilot in 2016. Most students are afraid to fly with her as she gets in their face when they don't perform.</p>

      <h1>Damian Richardson</h1>
      <p>Damian is an IT specialist and business analyst. He joined the team in 2014 and is the CFO. He is a business and finance geek. His finance knowledge is so deep that people sometimes don't understand him.</p>

    <div id="fourthName">
      <h1>Houssam Mostafa</h1>
      <p>Houssam is the newest member of the team. He is a student pilot and gets nauseous when he flies. The team hired him just because, but he doesn't submit work on time, so we'll see. </p>
