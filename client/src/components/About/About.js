    <p>
      Sky Logger allows a student pilot or a professional pilot to log their sky flight time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is intended to replace or supplement the paper logbook that all pilots have
      historically used.
      
      Sky logger inputs details identical to the logbook that all pilots are
      familiar with.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Sky Logger provides aggregate totals, which
      simplify filling out FAA and insurance applications, which could take a pilot
      significant time to compile with regulations to obtain their pilot license!
