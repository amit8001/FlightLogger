Flight Logger allows a student pilot or a professional pilot to log their flight time. 
It is intended to replace or supplement the paper logbook that all pilots have
historically used. Flight logger looks like the logbook that all pilots are 
familiar with. In addition, Flight Logger provides aggregate totals, which 
simplify filling out FAA and insurance applications, which could take a pilot
significant time to compile.
